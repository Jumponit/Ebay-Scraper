1. INTRO
================
Welcome to our Ebay price checking monitor system! This program is meant to be used to check the price history for an item so that you can make an informed decision before buying or selling!


2. USAGE
================
1. Launch the Ebay.exe application.
2. Enter the item you wish to search for in the text box beside the label “Item Name”
3. (Optional) Click the “Get Categories” button to generate a list of relevant categories to search through with the most frequently occurring categories at the top
NOTE: If no category is selected, a search in all categories will be used. 
4. (Optional) Click on a category in the list of categories
5. Click on the “Search” button to generate price information
6. Check the generated graphs to review the price history of the specified item over the last 90 days
NOTE: The “Help” button can be used to display a usage message

3. NOTES
================
The application may take a long time to search sometimes due to the number of results but even if it says "Not Responding" at the top of the window, it is probably just still working.
The color of the line of best fit correlates with the strength of the data. 
Red - Very Weak. Magenta - Weak. Yellow - Moderate. Cyan - Strong. Green - Very Strong.
